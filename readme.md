# The Cloud Donation - FE

This github repository is the frontend application for The Cloud Donation's website.

## About The Cloud Donation

The Cloud Donation proposes a cloud-based donation platform that leverages the latest technologies to simplify the donation process and provide increased anonymity and security for donors. The platform will allow donors to make a donation anonymously without the need for personal information. Donors will be able to choose from various payment options, including credit card, bank transfer, or mobile payment. The platform will be designed to be user-friendly, secure, and easily accessible on any device.

By leveraging cloud technologies and innovative features, the platform can help bridge the gap between donors and non-profit organizations, enabling more effective and efficient charitable giving.
